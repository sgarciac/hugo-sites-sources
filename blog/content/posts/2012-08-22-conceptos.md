**Cyber-Utopianism **: &#8220;A naîve belief in the emancipatory nature of online communication that rests on a stubborn refusal to acknowledge its downside&#8221; (Evgeny Morozov)

**Californian Ideology** : &#8220;The Californian Ideology is a set of beliefs combining bohemian and anti-authoritarian attitudes from the counterculture of the 1960s with techno-utopianism and support for neoliberal economic policies. These beliefs are thought by some to have been characteristic of the culture of the IT industry in Silicon Valley and the West Coast of the United States during the dot-com bubble of the 1990s.&#8221; (Wikipedia)
